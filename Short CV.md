I am an Algorithm Engineer at [Tencent](www.tencent.com) working on Natural Language Processing(NLP).

I designed a system to detect the vulgar and offensive video in which we used many machine learning and deep learning models, such as LSTM and CNN, and the data we used consists of Title, Comment, Cover and Video Frame. Now, the system has been deployed on one of the largest social network platform, which is called QZone, in China.

Topic I am currently excited about is the combination of NLP, Deep Reinforcement Learning and Generate Adversarial Nets. How to use the insight of Reinforcement Learning to solve the descreteness of NLP is the most amazing and fantastic problem for me.
